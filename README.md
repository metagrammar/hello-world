# hello-world

Hey y'all!

Look, this is me telling you a bit about myself in a branch to the read-me file. I'm learning how to use GitHub :-D

I'm a graphic designer that has been working as a UX / UI designer for some years now. I have been unemployed for some months and thought it was the best time to invest in a new career option. I have some experience writing HTML and CSS for the projects I designed (just code snippets and such), but I've always wanted to learn how to code / use JavaScript. This Full Stack developer course is the perfect opportunity to do so and I'm fully invested.
